# MR-Motion-Margins (MMM)
Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator Imaging Data Motion and Margins Calculations

## About
This project was initially created to analyse MR-Linac data in relation to 
pelvic organ motions and to provide data for adjustments to radiotherapy margins 
surrounding organs and malignant tumour.

## What's this for
The idea is to share this project for other researchers/clinicians/radiographers to use for looking at motion changes over different radiotherapy sessions. The aim is to get this project into a package or bunch of scripts to speed up the analysis of imaging data for radiotherapy margins. 

## To-do:
More updates to come in regards to this project:
    [ ] finalize analysis code
    [ Done! ] moving code to scripts - 28/2/2021
    [ ] cleaning up code - PEP8 / linting
    [ In progress ] adding more documentation 
    [ ] expand documentation

## Formulas being used and calculated
