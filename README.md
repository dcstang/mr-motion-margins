# MR-Mmotion-Margins (MMM)
Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator Imaging data motion and margins calculations

## About
This project was initially created to analyse MR-Linac data in relation to 
pelvic organ motions and to provide data for adjustments to radiotherapy margins 
surrounding organs and malignant tumour.

More updates to come in regards to this project.  
Currently in exploratory phase, will be moving code to scripts in the future.
I will need to do a lot of code spring cleaning and documentation first.
Please contact me for more information or if you'd like to collaborate.
