## About
This project was initially created to analyse MR-Linac data in relation to pelvic organ motions and to provide data for adjustments to radiotherapy margins surrounding organs and malignant tumour.

## Motivation
The idea is to share this project for other researchers/clinicians/radiographers to use for looking at motion changes over different radiotherapy sessions. The aim is to get this project into a package or bunch of scripts to speed up the analysis of imaging data for radiotherapy margins. 

Current radiotherapy processes require delineation of margins surrounding various clinical structures. However, to account for normal variations in physiological motions such as inhalation, exhalation, or bowel peristalsis, additional leeway needs to be provided on top of tumoral and structural margins. MRI image data can be used to assess how much motion occurs in the setting of radiotherapy treatment of patients with oncological conditions. 

The scripts here were used to collate and compute domain-specific metrics such as 'mean of means' and standard deviations for calculation of systematic and random errors in radiotherapy delivery.
